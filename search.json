    "text": "Here are a few things to keep in mind if you haven‚Äôt attended a Sikh Wedding.\n\n\n\nFor the Ceremony at the Gurdwara:\n\nMen: Traditional attire such as kurta-pajama or a suit. A head covering (like a handkerchief or turban) is required inside the Gurdwara.\nWomen: Traditional attire such as a salwar-kameez, saree, modest dress or a suit with pants. A head covering (like a scarf or dupatta) is required inside the Gurdwara.\nNote: Shoes must be removed before entering the Gurdwara.\n\nFor the Reception:\n\nMen: Traditional Indian attire or formal Western attire.\nWomen: Traditional Indian attire such as a lehenga, saree, or evening gown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilni (Introduction of Families):\n\nThis is a pre-wedding ritual where the families of the bride and groom meet and exchange garlands.\nIt is a warm and welcoming ceremony that signifies the union of two families.\n\nLangar (Community Meal):\n\nBefore the ceremony, a vegetarian meal will be served.\nLangar is a symbol of equality and community, so everyone sits together on the floor to eat.\n\nAnand Karaj (Wedding Ceremony):\n\nThis is the main wedding ceremony held at the Gurdwara (Sikh temple).\nThe ceremony involves singing of hymns, reading from the Guru Granth Sahib (Sikh holy book), and the couple walking around the holy book four times.\nPlease note that attendees will be seated on the floor during the ceremony, as this is a traditional practice in the Gurdwara. There will be some stools available for anyone who may find it difficult to sit on the floor. If you believe you will need a stool, please indicate so on the RSVP or contact the bride or groom.\n\nReception:\n\nThe reception will follow the Anand Karaj, featuring music, dance, and a celebratory meal.",
