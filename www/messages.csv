The belonging you seek is not behind you, it is ahead &mdash; together. I know the Force [Love]. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes, feel it. The light. It's always been there. It will guide you, for luminous beings you are, not this crude matter. And despite everything, it's still you &mdash; together.<br><br>

Best wishes to you both! Cheers to a lifetime together &#x1F60A;<br><br>
