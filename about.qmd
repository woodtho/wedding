# What To Expect At a Sikh Wedding

Here are a few things to keep in mind if you havenâ€™t attended a Sikh Wedding.

## Events

1.  **Milni (Introduction of Families):**

    -   This is a pre-wedding ritual where the families of the bride and groom meet and exchange garlands.

    -   It is a warm and welcoming ceremony that signifies the union of two families.

2.  **Langar (Community Meal):**

    -   Before the ceremony, a vegetarian meal will be served.
    -   Langar is a symbol of equality and community, so everyone sits together on the floor to eat.

3.  **Anand Karaj (Wedding Ceremony):**

    -   This is the main wedding ceremony held at the Gurdwara (Sikh temple).

    -   The ceremony involves singing of hymns, reading from the Guru Granth Sahib (Sikh holy book), and the couple walking around the holy book four times.
